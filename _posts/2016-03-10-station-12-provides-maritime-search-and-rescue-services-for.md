Boating Safety for the Whole Family with Bobbie the Boat
The focus of "Bobbie the Boat" is primarily children; although the educational device is a hit with everyone in the community. Bobbie is a robotic boat that has all of the features of a real boat; a boat that in this case talks to children. Through sophisticated communication systems we are able to talk remotely to children and hear their responses. Bobbie is guided by one of our volunteers who would remain out of sight of the boat. Bobbie goes through a scripted safety message that is focused on children of all ages and one that can be adapted to almost any venue. During the past year we visited schools and attended public events in an effort to get our safety message across; we estimate that last year alone we touched over 1,000 citizens of the District.
