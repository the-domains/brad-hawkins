Open Letter to The Grid builders,

I would say this software is an Alpha product. I think you mislabeled this phase as beta testing. You have lost my trust in the grid. I think most Founding Members would run from this product, if they knew what the experience was going to be before they pulled out their credit cards and handed over $96\.

You say let The Grid's AI build a beautiful website- pictures and text do not show most of the time, but they are there when I go to edit. I can not use this product, I am frustrated most of the time with the results and I cannot fix them directly when I know what is wrong. I have noticed you are giving out refunds to people. Please acknowledge that the grid will issue me a refund in 30 days or I'll post on your Facebook page as it seems that will get a sure reaction from the grid. Talk soon or see you on social media... You have my info, contact me even if it is aüñïüèª belligerent email.

I would not even give my time to beta test this product for free. I beta tested software before and it was fun Ableton knows how to do it with their Live DAW program. It is more worth my time to battle for a refund than use your product. I am right now rebuilding a non profit website and it is looking awesome- we are all pleased with the word press site. I wish I used that money on squarespace for my site.

Regards,

brad hawkins
