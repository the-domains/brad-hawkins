Open Letter to The Grid builders,

I would say this software is Alpha. I would **never** call this software in it's beta phase. If this website builder is beta, well I would **hate** to see what your idea of a finished product is. I think you mislabeled this phase as beta and The Grid promised more then it could deliver. You have one chance to keep a person's unconditional trust, you have lost it with many people. Now you not only have to build a better product, but build the trust of your customers. I think most Founding Members would run from this product, if they could get a refund.

You say let The Grid's AI build a beautiful website- it treats photos like they where supposed to be Instagram posts, text has shitty placement and fonts combinations. I am sorry but I can build a better website then this AI any day.

$96 of my money well taken. Hope you enjoy it The Grid.
